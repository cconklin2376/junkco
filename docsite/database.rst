Database Structure
==================

The current structure of the database is stored in the environment at **junkco/etc/mysql/PayrollDb.sql**

This is a mysql database consisting of several tables that cover the majority of data needed for testing and filler.

There is also a second database Tanner_base that is more enterprise-like but overly complex for simple testing.
